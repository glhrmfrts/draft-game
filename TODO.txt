Current TODOs:

- (Game) Add crystals to the game (crystals should be pink)
- (Game) Add obstacles to the game, that rises as the time comes (think of a color to them)
- (Game) Assign different roles for ships with different colors (blue is normal, red kills you, green does something)
- (Game) Work on the camera movement to be more dynamic
- (Audio) Implement audio system and ship engine sounds
- (Renderer) Fix bloom artifacts
- (Renderer) Fix order of rendering (sort by distance)
- (Renderer) Frustum culling
- (Audio) Add some soundtrack! (trance/dnb sounds awesome)

- OK (Game) Make the ambient light affected by an explosion


Compass and straightedge constructions
It is relatively straightforward to construct a line t tangent to a circle at a point T on the circumference of the circle:

A line a is drawn from O, the center of the circle, through the radial point T;
The line t is the perpendicular line to a.



Construction of a tangent to a given circle (black) from a given exterior point (P).
Thales' theorem may be used to construct the tangent lines to a point P external to the circle C:

A circle is drawn centered on the midpoint of the line segment OP, where O is again the center of the circle C.
The intersection points T1 and T2 are the tangent points for lines passing through P, by the following argument.
The line segments OT1 and OT2 are radii of the circle C; since both are inscribed in a semicircle, they are perpendicular to the line segments PT1 and PT2, respectively. But only a tangent line is perpendicular to the radial line. Hence, the two lines from P and passing through T1 and T2 are tangent to the circle C.
