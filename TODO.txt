Current TODOs:

- (Game) Add crystals to the game (crystals should be pink)
- (Game) Add obstacles to the game, that rises as the time comes (think of a color to them)
- (Game) Assign different roles for ships with different colors (blue is normal, red kills you, green does something)
- (Game) Work on the camera movement to be more dynamic
- (Audio) Implement audio system and ship engine sounds
- (Renderer) Fix bloom artifacts
- (Renderer) Fix order of rendering (sort by distance)
- (Renderer) Frustum culling
- (Audio) Add some soundtrack! (trance/dnb sounds awesome)

- OK (Game) Make the ambient light affected by an explosion
